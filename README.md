# RogueItemTracker
### Why?
I'm a college student powerlifter who as many people during COVID-19 was 
unable to access the gym. As a result, I decided to create a home gym and to do 
that I needed some gym equipment. However, many sites were out of stock, especially
Rogue, my favorite fitness company. As a result, I decided to create this bot
to update myself whenever an equipment is back in stock. I encountered a community
on reddit r/homegym where other users faced the same problem and I decided this would
be a great tool to help others just like me.
